    Deep Learning Deep Learning is a part of Machine Learning itself. It deals with algorithms that are inspired by the structure and function of the brain. Deep Learning has led to great results in the field of Machine Learning and Computer Vision. Deep Learning: Advantage The major advantage of Deep Learning is that it does not need feature engineering. We can use the raw pixels from the image as the features. This is mainly possible because the classifier used in Deep Learning is a neural network. Neural networks can learn complex functions. Under the hood, Deep Learning uses multiple layers of neurons. Creating a neural network from scratch is not that easy. TensorFlow has proved to be extremely helpful in doing this for us. TensorFlow TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library by Google. I recommend using TensorFlow for deep learning as it can handle all the tasks required to create and train a neural network. One of the most important features of TensorFlow is that we can save the trained model as a binary file. The reason why TensorFlow is good at creating neural networks is that it doesn’t actually create a neural network from scratch. Instead, it retrains an existing classifier called Inception. Inception Inception is one of Google’s best image classifiers. In fact, it is one of the most powerful image classifiers out in the world. An average image classifier is trained on around 1000–2000 images. Inception was trained over 1.2 million that range over 1000 categories. This was done over the duration of 2 weeks on a desktop with 8 GPUs. Retraining Inception Retraining inception (transfer learning) has several advantages: It saves a lot of our time because are not creating a classifier all over again. It also gives the system the reusability and accuracy that inception has. While you’ll need 1000 images at least to train a new classifier. Retraining inceptions require around 100 images per category. React-Native TensorFlow React-Native TensorFlow is an open source library for React Native. It provides us with 2 APIs API for Direct interaction with TensorFlow. A simple image recognition API. Image Recognition API Using the image recognition API is super easy. All you need to do is these 5 steps: Create a rn-cli.config.js file in the root of the project. Add TensorFlow model and Label file to it. module.exports = { getAssetExts() { return ['pb', 'txt'] } } Here, pb is the extension of the output model file and txt is the extension for the label file. 2. Add TensorFlow model file to assets: tensorflow_inception_graph.pb 3. Add the label file as to the assets: tensorflow_labels.txt 4. Initialize tfImageRecognition API class using the model and the label: const tfImageRecognition = new tfImageRecognition({ model: require('./assets/tensorflow_inception_graph.pb'), labels: require('./assets/tensorflow_labels.txt'), }); 5. Call recognize function with the image to recognize: const results = await ifImageRecognition.recognize({ image: require('./assets/panda.jpg'), });
